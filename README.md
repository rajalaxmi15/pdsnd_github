### Project Title
Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description

This Python script is written for Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree. Bike share data contains data about bicycle renting in three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. The script imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

How to run the script

Script can be run using Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. This script is written in Python 3, so Python 3.x version of the installer is needed.

Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017.  The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
•	Start Time
•	End Time
•	Trip Duration (in seconds)
•	Start Station
•	End Station
•	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
•	Gender
•	Birth Year

Questions explored

The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:
•	What is the most popular month for start time?
•	What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
•	What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
•	What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
•	What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
•	What is the most popular trip?
•	What are the counts of each user type?
•	What are the counts of gender?
•	What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
